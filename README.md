# 🛡️ Sentinel-X Defense Platform
Sentinel-X is a unified, next-generation network traffic analysis and simulated threat detection platform. Designed for speed and clarity in forensic investigation and real-time monitoring, it utilizes custom multi-threading to simulate live network traffic and advanced threat signatures.
## ✨ Features
* **Real-time Traffic Monitoring:** Continuously simulates and displays network packets, including source/destination IP, protocol, and length.
* **Threat Detection:** Identifies and flags simulated security events like **SQL Injection**, **XSS Attempts**, **Buffer Overflow**, and **Zero-Day Exploits** with severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
* **IP Range Analysis:** Allows targeted simulation of IP Detail Record (IPDR) data for a specified IP range.
* **Data Export:** Export all current buffered packets to a downloadable JSON file via the `/api/export_packets` endpoint.
* **Traffic Control:** API endpoints to start, stop, and clear the simulated traffic generator.
## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You must have **Python 3.9+** installed.
### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Sentinel-traffic-analyzer.git](https://github.com/your-username/Sentinel-traffic-analyzer.git)
    cd Sentinel-traffic-analyzer
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The application uses Flask and a `requests` for the API client.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Generate SSL Certificates:**
    The application runs over **HTTPS** and requires self-signed certificates in the `certs/` folder.
    ```bash
    python gen_certs.py
    ```
    This script will create the `certs/key.pem` and `certs/cert.pem` files.

### Running the Application

Start the Flask server. The `app.py` script automatically initializes and starts the `TrafficEngine` in a background thread.

```bash
python app.py
